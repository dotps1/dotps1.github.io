Had a great time last night at [BarcampGR](http://barcampgr.org).  A few [GRPosh](https://grposh.github.io) members gave some great talks.  Huge shoutout to everyone from [BarcampGR](http://barcampgr.org) for putting a great conference, and to everyone from [GRPosh](https://grposh.github.io) for there presentations.

I personally did a session on getting started with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  It went pretty good, but it was difficult to get all the content I wanted to in a 25 minute session.  And of course, the Demo Gods are never easy on me!  Had a few technical difficulties.  Anyway, you can find the session outline and the session video below, enjoy!
