As automation grows in the IT workplace, it maybe be growing to fast for a lot of folks to keep up with.  PowerShell is taking over the Windows World, and now is moving into the UNIX and Mac spaces as well.  I have attended the [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](http://powershellsummit.org/) three out of the five years it has been running, and it has some of the best content of any conference I have had the pleasure of being part of.  That being said, the great people at [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org) have come up with a great idea of giving scholarships to a few fine deserving individuals so they can attend the Summit if they maybe struggling to find administrative approval.

I was discussing with [Don Jones](https://donjones.com/), president of [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org), on ways I could help out with the organization.  He asked me if I would take on the tasks involed with the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit Scholarship.  To be honest, I was a little worried, as I have never done anything like this, especially on such scale.  But none the less here where are, the announcement page has been posted, you can find it [here](https://powershell.org/2017/08/01/powershell-devops-global-summit-scholarship-program/) to get all the program details.

The main goal of this program is to hopefully reach individuals that would be considered part of a group which is "under represented" in the IT industry as a whole, including women, underrepresented minorities, overworked help desk staff, and so on. So, if you're the IT Director, or the Senior Systems Architect, this program is not targeted at you; however, if you know an individual that fits this description, please encourage them to apply.

We will be accepting applications for the month of September.  My panel of three Microsoft MVPs and I will deliberate throught the month of October, and announce a winner in Novemeber.  Again, for more information, and how to apply, go to [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org/2017/08/01/powershell-devops-global-summit-scholarship-program/).

Please spread the word to anyone who may not yet be involved in the PowerShell network.  Don't let them miss this opportunity!

Good luck!
