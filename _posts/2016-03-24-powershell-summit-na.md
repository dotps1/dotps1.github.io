The PowerShell Summit NA 2016 is just over a week away, and I am getting very excited to go.  It will be a much-needed vacation, not to mention seeing some great people from the PowerShell Community.


The Summit will be held in Bellevue Washington this year, same as 2014.  Last year it was in Charlotte North Carolina.  It was fun, and there was some great people there, but I enjoyed Bellevue more in 2014.
