## About

I'm Thomas Malkewitz (@dotps1), a System Engineer with a passion for automation and scripting, especially with PowerShell.
I'm also the Founder/President of the Grand Rapids PowerShell User Group.
I am heavily involved with <a href="PowerShell.org">PowerShell.org</a>, and am active member of the global powershell community.
I enjoy making PowerShell _Wrappers_ for hard to use or dated DOS command line tools, or other applications that do not have PowerShell cmdlets.
I also enjoy making helper functions that are missing from the core functionality of PowerShell for everyday use.
