## Projects

[GRPosh](https://grposh.github.io) - My PowerShell User Group website.

[PSFunctions](https://github.com/dotps1/PSFunctions) - A Github repository to hold the source for all of my _Script-Functions_ that are available on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/dotps1).  These are Advanced Functions that do not fit in any of my existing modules

[WinSCP](https://github.com/dotps1/WinSCP) - A PowerShell wrapper that gives the feeling of working with [WinSCP](https://winscp.net) objects and methods in native PowerShell.

[PSGist](https://github.com/dotps1/PSGist) - A PowerShell Module used for creating and modifying Github Gist objects using the [Github REST API](https://developer.github.com/).

[PSWecutil](https://github.com/dotps1/PSWecutil) - A PowerShell Module that wrappers the Windows Event Collector utility ([wecutil.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb736545%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)), to allow configuration to be much easier by working with objects rather than parsing string output.

[PSAppVeyor](https://github.com/dotps1/PSAppVeyor) - A PowerShell module used to interface with the [AppVeyor REST API](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/api/).

[HPWarranty](https://github.com/dotps1/HPWarranty) - A PowerShell module used to query HP and HPE for system warranty information.
